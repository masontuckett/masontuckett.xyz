# About Me
I am currently a 21-year-old teacher assistant, contract network deployment specialist, and full-time graduate student at Western Governors University—diligently pursuing an [MS in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cybersecurity-information-assurance-masters-program.html).

During my time at Weber State University, I completed my undergraduate degree in just under three years—with no incoming credits—undertaking heavy course loads, using summers and every spare hour to propel myself forward.

In addition to a rigorous, year-round course schedule, I made a considerable effort toward accelerating my MS program through [pre-enrollment certification equivalency](https://partners.wgu.edu/master-of-science-in-cyber-security-and-information-assurance)—significantly expediting my degree.

Despite my intensive technical background, my true goal is to both live and fully embody a life of service—meaningfully giving back to my community and empowering the youth; hence my ardent transition to education. 

In the near future, I will begin my [Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Teaching (Secondary)](https://www.weber.edu/teachered/graduate-certificate-teaching.html)—aiming for licensure and [Cybersecurity/IT/CS endorsements](https://schools.utah.gov/cte/educatorendorsements) from the Utah State Board of Education.

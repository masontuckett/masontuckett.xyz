A Personal Update on My Transition to Education

## A Need for Clarification

In my personal life, I have received a lot of confusion and outright bewilderment as to why I am choosing to *temporarily* transition into secondary education. 

As I am relatively public, and this website serves as a sort of refined *__proof of character__*—I wanted to dispel the misconceptions and vast mischaracterizations levied against my trajectory. 

## "WHY!?"

To outsiders, it appears as if I am throwing away a fledgling, long-term career in cybersecurity; __that is objectively the furthest thing from the truth.__

I had tried for years to enter the cybersecurity market during my time at Weber State University—__*all to no avail*__. 

Suddenly, my efforts started to rapidly catch up to me, and everything changed once I concluded undergrad. 

A slew of job offers, significant recruiter outreach, and several tenured professionals offering referrals—__*all at once*__.

__*What changed?*__

{{< small >}}Absolutely nothing—merely a piece of paper adorning my wall.{{</ small >}}

Consequently, this left me in a state of immense disarray, absolutely appalled—culminating in an arduous, nearly two-month-long period of intense introspection. 

## What I Realized

I intrinsically, fundamentally disagree with cybersecurity's current state of rampant credentialism, egoism, nepotism, and overt gatekeeping.

As a person of such impressive credentials (*__given my age__*), I never found myself claiming *SME-level expertise*.

{{< small >}}Why must this be such a pervasive issue?{{</ small >}}

__I had witnessed this firsthand:__ plagiarized presentations, falsified credentials, glorifying aims to work for highly unethical corporations, and extreme embellishment to the point of outright deceit. 

{{< small >}}But it never really "clicked" until just recently.{{</ small >}}

*I was faced with an existential, spiritual rot—of which I want no part of.*

## My Journey

I am not some *"prodigy"* or *"gifted individual"—I am a man who had to earn and fight __tooth and nail__ for everything I have ever achieved.*

I entered college with zero plans or in-depth understanding of technology; *I was quite infantile, toying with computers as a hobby.* 

__The only reason I even pursued higher education was because I was given a life-defining ultimatum:__

- The Air Force
- Vocational School
- Homelessness

I was nearly a [high school drop-out](https://web.archive.org/web/20251026111432/https://prezi.com/p/pdoo8ktodsxb/booth-and-hamlet-justifications/) at age sixteen—migrating to online education—*in hopes of recovering what little I had left.*

Even at that moment, I still chose not to do critical homework, contingent upon my graduation, for nearly two years—*up until age eighteen.*

{{< small >}}Abysmal ACT scores and a nonexistent GPA.{{</ small>}}

So you may understand just how discouraged I was—*having to construct everything from scratch*—__*by hand*__.

{{< small >}}Without the educational scaffolding or innocence many children hold during childhood.{{</ small >}}

In the years to come, as I received a highly sudden yet continuous flow of praise—*I was left stewing, questioning:*

__What Now?__

## Service as a Career

I harkened back to my time as an instructor at Ken Garff's summer tech track—and the countless hours I spent debugging with [Smith](https://smithbarlow.net).

{{< small >}}I realized in that moment that my life should be for and in the service of others.{{</ small >}}

I declined lucrative offers, and opportunities, and referrals, and set my sights on pursuing teaching licensure—with an excruciating fervor.

{{< small >}}A sharp juxtaposition to my idea of education as a cheap contingency option.{{</ small >}}

To build myself from the ground up, I took a TA position at a local elementary school—*with __zero__ understanding of what I'd be doing.*

Entering the role was among the most difficult adjustments I had made in my career.

__Far surpassing any academic work or position I have ever held.__ 

It has been the most rewarding experience of my life—*providing a level of happiness I have never known.* 

## The Future

While I am focusing on adjunct roles at technical colleges in the near future, secondary education gives me an incredible platform. 

I am uniquely positioned—attaining invaluable experience while having plenty of time for PhD coursework.

Additionally, I will absolutely continue my contracted network engineering projects—*compounding into my aim to do technical consulting.*

{{< small >}}I am not "ditching" my technical background, but strategically adapting to preemptively advance beyond my years.{{</ small >}}

Professorship is my end goal—*building a profile for mentoring __lost men in a sea of disillusionment and demoralization__*.

Hence my desire to become involved with the youth—*hopefully, in due time,* *__piloting initiatives to ensure children receive the scaffolding I never had__*. 


## The Present (Game Plan)

- *Continue volunteer work*
- *Continue mentoring Smith*
- *Finish my catalog of technical articles*
- *Earn [PCAP](https://github.com/masontuckett/pcap-prep)/[CPE](https://github.com/masontuckett/cpe-prep) certs so I may better teach students*
- *Earn CCNA/RHCSA for adjunct roles*
